# 2454-slides

This small project is a set of slides, in portuguese (pt-BR), for the
discipline MAT-2454, covering multivariate calculus, at least the
"differential part" (limits, continuity, differentiable functions, maximum and
minimum on open or compact sets).

The classes are taught to engineering students at Escola Politécnica of
Universidade de São Paulo.

This project is done using the slideshow format of PreTeXt: [https://github.com/PreTeXtBook/pretext].
